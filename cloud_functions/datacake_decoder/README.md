# Datacake HTTP Payload Decoder

This JavaScript code is designed to be pasted into the HTTP Payload Decoder section for a device on the Datacake platform.

It parses the SenML JSON format sent by the KPN Things destination and correctly maps the values to the device's fields.

**Setup:**
1.  Copy the code from `decoder.js`.
2.  In Datacake, go to your device's Configuration tab.
3.  Paste the code into the "HTTP Payload Decoder" editor.
4.  **Important:** Change the `YOUR_DATACAKE_SERIAL_NUMBER_HERE` placeholder to your actual device serial number.
